      <h3>1. Bible</h3>
      <p>
        We believe that the original manuscripts of the sixty-six books of the Old and New Testaments is verbally inspired by God in all their parts, are inerrant, and are the supreme and final authority in faith and conduct.
      </p>

      <h3>2. The Triune God</h3>
      <p>
      We believe in one triune God, eternally, existing in three persons God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit co-eternal in being, co-identical in nature, who created all things, and accomplished the work of redemption.
      We believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of the Father, who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, and is sinless. He was crucified on the cross for the redemption of human sins, and was bodily resurrected on the third day. He ascended into heaven, sits on the right side of the Father interceding for all believers. One day, He will return to earth on His glorious body.
      We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Third Person of the Triune God, who convicts the world of sin. He indwells believers, unites them with the Lord, and endows them with power to live holy lives.
      </p>



      <h3>3.The Origin and Fall of Man</h3>
      <p>
        We believe that man was created in the image and after the likeness of God, and was not evolved from any lower form of animal life. Sin entered the world through the fall of Adam and the human race inherited a sinful nature from him. As a result, man is alienated from God, and subjectd to His divine wrath and judgment.
      </p>

      <h3>4. The Way of Redemption</h3>
      <p>
        We believe that redemption is solely by the grace of God, and the remission of sins is through the precious blood of Jesus Christ and through personal faith in Him. There is no other way to salvation apart from Christ. We believe in the eternal security of believers, once saved, forever secured.
      </p>

      <h3>5. The Chruch</h3>
      <p>
        We believe that the Church is the body of Christ, and Christ is the head of the Church. The Church is the body of born-again believers called by God’s grace, bonded by His love, and organized under the preaching and teaching of the Scriptures for worship and fellowship.
      </p>

      <h3>6. The Second Coming of Jesus Christ</h3>
      <p>
        We believe that Christ will return one day according to the prophetic promises of the Scriptures to judge the living and the dead to establish His Kingdom forever.

 * 我們的信仰立場:

聖經 :
我們相信全部新舊約聖經六十六卷書的原稿， 是神所默示的，是完全無誤的。聖經是我們信仰與行為, 唯一最高的準則和權威。
三一真神:
我們相信三一真神。神乃聖父、神乃聖子、神乃聖靈，三位一體，在永恆中共存，並且同質、同權；是萬物之創造主, 完成救贖的唯一真神。
我們相信耶穌基督乃神的獨一兒子，因聖靈感孕，藉童貞女馬利亞而生，完全無罪。後被釘十字架，為人代死贖罪，三日後復活，並且升天，坐在神的右邊，為信徒代求。有一天，耶穌基督必帶著榮耀之身體重臨地上。
我們相信聖靈是三一神之第三位。祂使世人知罪；祂在信徒心中居住；祂使信徒與主聯合，並賜能力使信徒過聖潔生活。
人的起源和墮落 :
我們相信人是照著神的形像和樣式被造的。罪因始祖亞當的墮落進入世界，人的罪性，因而就與生俱來。罪使人與神隔絕，使人要遭受神的震怒和審判。
唯一拯救 :
我們相信人的得救是唯獨恩典。唯有藉著基督寶血的救贖，並且相信祂，罪便得赦免。我們相信一個重生得救的信徒，他們的救恩永遠不會失落。
教會 :
我們相信教會是基督的身體，基督為教會的頭。教會乃是蒙神恩典所呼召，重生得救的信徒之身體。他們在主裏相顧相愛，透過聖經的宣講和教導，同心敬拜和過團契生活。
基督再來 :
我們相信聖經所預言的應許。耶穌基督必將再來世上， 審判地上一切活人、死人，並且建立祂永遠的國度。
